Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'.
Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number.
Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.
  


def computepay(hours,rate):
 if hours>40.0:
  p = rate * 40.0
  p = p+(1.5*rate*(hours-40))
 else:
  p = rate*hours
 return p
hours = float(raw_input("Enter worked hours: "))
rate = float(raw_input("Enter Pay rate per hour: "))
print("Pay", computepay(hours,rate))
